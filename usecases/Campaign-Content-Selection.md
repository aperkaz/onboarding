In Campaign editor the user gets a visual preview of all available global and customer specific templates.
The preview uses either the first contact in the campaign or a dummy contact (if no contacts are defined, e.g. for anonymous campaign).
In case more templates exist than fit on screen, user is able to scroll through them.
Clicking on any content preview will open the preview in a new tab so the user is able to read it.
